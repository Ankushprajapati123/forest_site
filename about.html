                A forest is a large area dominated by trees and other woody vegetation. It's a vital ecosystem that
                provides
                numerous benefits, including maintaining the planet's balance, providing habitat for various species,
                and
                regulating climate. Forests are crucial for human well-being, offering resources like timber, food, and
                medicines, as well as essential environmental services like carbon sequestration and soil protection.

                Forests are broadly classified into three major types: tropical, temperate, and boreal. These categories
                are primarily determined by latitude and climate, influencing the types of trees and ecosystems found in
                each region. Within these broad categories, there are various sub-types of forests, such as evergreen,
                deciduous, coniferous, and mangrove forests, each with unique characteristics.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tropical Rainforests:</strong> Characterized by high rainfall, high biodiversity, and warm
                    temperatures year-round.</li>
                <li><strong>Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests:</strong> Found in areas with distinct wet and dry seasons,
                    with trees shedding leaves during the dry period.</li>
                <li><strong>Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests:</strong> Have a longer dry season and lower rainfall than
                    moist deciduous forests.</li>
                <li><strong>Tropical Thorn Forests:</strong> Adapted to arid conditions with thorny trees and shrubs.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mangrove Forests:</strong> Found in coastal intertidal zones, with specialized trees that
                    can tolerate saltwater.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperate Deciduous Forests:</strong> Experience four distinct seasons, with trees shedding
                    leaves in the fall.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperate Coniferous Forests:</strong> Dominated by cone-bearing evergreen trees like pines
                    and firs.</li>
                <li><strong>Mediterranean Forests:</strong> Found in regions with mild, wet winters and hot, dry
                    summers.</li>
                <li><strong>Montane Forests:</strong> Located in mountainous areas, with varying vegetation types
                    depending on altitude and climate.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                Located in high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, these forests are dominated by coniferous
                trees
                adapted to cold, harsh winters and short growing seasons.
            </p>

        <section>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mangrove Forests:</strong> Grow in coastal, saltwater habitats, characterized by
                    salt-tolerant trees with unique adaptations.</li>
                <li><strong>Montane Forests:</strong> Found in mountainous regions, the types of trees and plants change
                    with increasing altitude and cooler temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Mediterranean Forests:</strong> Adapted to dry summers and mild, wet winters, these forests
                    have unique vegetation that can tolerate drought.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Forests:</strong> High-altitude forests characterized by persistent cloud cover and
                    high humidity.</li>
