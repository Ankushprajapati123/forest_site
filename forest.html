    <li>Deforestation</li>
    <div id="nav">
        Deforestation or forest clearance is the removal and destruction of a forest or stand of trees from land that is
        then converted to non-forest use.[1] Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or
        urban use. About 31% of Earth's land surface is covered by forests at present.[2] This is one-third less than
        the forest cover before the expansion of agriculture, with half of that loss occurring in the last century.[3]
        Between 15 million to 18 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Bangladesh, are destroyed every year.
        On average 2,400 trees are cut down each minute.<p>
            <li>Illegal logging</li>
            To cut wood, you must first make sure you have the necessary permission, especially if you are cutting wood
            from public land or a forested area. Next, you need to cut the wood using appropriate tools and safety
            measures .
        <p>
            <li>forest fires</li>
            Forest fires, also known as wildfires, are uncontrolled and unmanaged blazes that consume vegetation in
            natural settings like forests, grasslands, and tundra. These fires are fueled by a combination of natural
            and human-related causes, including lightning strikes, high temperatures, and human carelessness. The spread
            of a forest fire depends on factors like wind, topography, and the availability of dry fuel like leaves and
            dead wood.
        <p>
            <li>Urbanization</li>
            Urbanization is a process in which a large portion of the population moves from rural areas to urban areas,
            causing cities to grow both in size and population. It is an ever-changing process that creates a contrast
            between rural and urban life.
